  The main aim of this blog is to present the practice of 
  Data science with only as much theory as required to 
  complete a task. The tutorials are project-base; exhibiting 
  the complete pipeline that may be required to complete a given
  Data Science project.
  Given that different tasks are geared toward varied objectives and outcomes,
  one can expect the scope of the tutorials to differ accordingly.
